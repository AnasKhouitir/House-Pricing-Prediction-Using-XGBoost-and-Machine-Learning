Title: House Pricing Prediction Using XGBoost and Machine Learning

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property characteristics. The model was built using XGBoost, a highly efficient and scalable machine learning algorithm for regression tasks.

Key steps in the project include:

Data Handling:

Imported and preprocessed the dataset using Pandas and NumPy to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the relationships between the features and house prices.
Plotted correlations, distributions, and trends to gain insights into the data.
Model Building:

Splitted the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from Scikit-learn.
Implemented the XGBoost Regressor for building the house price prediction model, leveraging its advanced boosting techniques for accurate predictions.
Evaluation:

Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score from Scikit-learn to ensure the model's accuracy and robustness.
Performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and data science techniques for a practical problem — predicting house prices with a focus on accuracy and model performance using XGBoost.
